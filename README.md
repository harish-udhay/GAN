In this project, we are solving the image transformation
problem, where an input image is transformed into an output
image. We are training the Generative Adverserial Network
to train an unlabelled data set that is capable of generating
the photo-realistic images. The machine is taught to learn the
characteristics of pizza from the dataset and then it generates
similar designs using the characteristics that the model learns
from the dataset. This report also shows qualitative results that
indicates the performance of the Generative Adverserial Network
on the synthetic and real pizza dataset.

Below are the screenshots of the dataset and the images generated by GAN
